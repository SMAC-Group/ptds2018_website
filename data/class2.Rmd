## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. On other link [super book](htpps://ptds2018.netlify.com). ![](https://www.alumnihec.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unilogo_bleu_300dpi-e1431428186368.jpg)

When you click the __*Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:*__

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots {#sec-includ}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.width=3, fig.height=4, fig.align='right'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

To create an unordered list:   

* A   
    + A1
    + A2   
* B 
* C

Ordered list: 

1. A
2. B
3. C

$\alpha \Longleftrightarrow 1$
