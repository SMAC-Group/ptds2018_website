We will be using Piazza for class-related discussion and questions, to help you benefit from each other’s questions and the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. Questions can be posted to the entire class (for content-related questions). I encourage you to ask questions if you are struggling to understand a concept, and to answer your classmates’ questions when you can.

{{% notice warning %}}
**Do Not** use Piazza for issues related to your grade or other private matters (not even an instructor post). Email those questions or comments to the instructor directly or discuss them in person.

### Email
Most issues about classroom activities can be posted to Piazza, but you should use email (or a conversation in person) for all personal or private matters.
