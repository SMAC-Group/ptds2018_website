To make sure that your project is suitable we organize a project proposal presentation on October 23d, 2018. It consists of a 5 minutes presentation (make sure you respect that!) where you should try to "sell" your project idea to the class. This presentation can be done in any form but you should address the following points:

1. **Problem / Topic**: What problem or topic are you addressing? Why is it worth doing? Will you be able to use the project as a way to demonstrate your R savvy-ness (e.g. to future employers, application to grad school)?   
2. **Idea**: What is your idea for addressing the problem or topic? Why is it original relative to prior work? Where did the idea come from?   
3. **Feasibility**: Is this project able to be completed before the end of the semester? What steps must occur to complete the project before the end of the semester?
