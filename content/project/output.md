The output of your project must be:

1. An awesome project!  
2. A well documented GitHub repository (see e.g. https://github.com/SMAC-Group/ds) which should be called groupX_project where X is your group number.  
3. A website showcasing your work (think of adding a screencast video) used as a GitHub page (see e.g. https://smac-group.github.io/stat297/).  
4. An R package that can be installed directly from GitHub (such as the stat297 package which can be installed as devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/stat297")). More specifically this package should have:  
  + A DESCRIPTION file with all necessary information including, but not limited to, Package title, general description, dependencies, license, and imports.  
  + R/Rcpp functions with documentation including title, description, parameters, authors, exports, and at least one example.  
  + A well formatted package skeleton (man, inst, docs, R, etc.)
  + A shiny app to allow someone having absolutely no R knowledge to “use” what you have done in your project.  
  + This package should work. This means that the instructors should be able to call all necessary (intended) functions with yourpackage::yourfunction.
